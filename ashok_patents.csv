The processor includes yet another logic to selectively send the interrupt to a single one of the logical processors associated with the error bank.,https://patents.google.com/patent/US9842015
Instruction and logic for machine check interrupt management,9864603,2018-01-09,"Mohan J. Kumar, Ashok Raj",Intel Corporation,"A processor includes a front end including a decoder to decode an instruction, a scheduler to assign execution of the instruction to a core, and a core to execute the instruction. The instruction specifies that interrupts such as corrected machine check interrupts are to be selectively suppressed. The processor further includes an error handling unit including logic to determine that an interrupt caused by an error is to be created and that an error consumer has requested interrupt notification....",https://patents.google.com/patent/US9864603
Interfacing with block-based storage in a processor,9904586,2018-02-27,"Hisham Shafi, Mohan J. Kumar, Ron Gabor, Ashok Raj, Theodros Yigzaw",Intel Corporation,"In one embodiment, a processor includes a core having a fetch unit to fetch instructions, a decode unit to decode the instructions, and one or more execution units to execute the instructions. The core may further include: a first pair of block address range registers to store a start location and an end location of a block range within a non-volatile block storage coupled to the processor; and a block status storage to store an error indicator responsive to an occurrence of an error within the ...",https://patents.google.com/patent/US9904586
