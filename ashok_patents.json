In response to a successful transfer indication, a logical address is re-mapped to a physical address of the new region of the destination memory, instead of a physical address of the original region of the destination memory. In one embodiment, the re-mapping is performed by a central processing unit. In another embodiment, the re-mapping is performed by the offload data transfer engine.

For packets received that are to be written to a memory buffer associated with an accelerator device, the network interface controller can determine an address translation of a destination memory address of the received packet and determine whether to use a secondary head. If a translated address is available and a secondary head is to be used, a direct memory access (DMA) engine is used to copy a portion of the received packet via the accelerator fabric to a destination memory buffer associated with the address translation. Accordingly, copying a portion of the received packet through the host-to-device fabric and to a destination memory can be avoided and utilization of the host-to-device fabric can be reduced for accelerator bound traffic.",

    "title": "Context based alert system",
    "summary": "An embodiment allows for context based alerts/alarms. For example, an embodiment may automatically determine that a user is in a meeting with another person based on a meeting entry in the user's calendar. In such a situation the embodiment may divert an incoming phone call, which would ordinarily result in a ring tone, to go directly to voice mail based on the calendar entry. In an embodiment the alert may be delayed until the meeting concludes. Unlike conventional systems, various embodiments do not require a user to change notification rules, manually flip a hardware switch, or create a “Do Not Disturb” setting that allows just a single “silent” time during the day. An embodiment allows data in a calendar to automatically drive the behavior of how a notification panel operates. Other embodiments are described herein.",
