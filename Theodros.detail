            the system can dynamically perform one or more of: allocate
            active memory device space for sparing to spare a failed memory
            segment; write a poison pattern into a failed cacheline to mark
            it as failed; perform permanent fault detection (PFD) and
            adjust application of ECC based on PFD detection; or, spare
            only a portion of a device and leave another portion active,
            including adjusting ECC based on the spared portion. The error
            detection can be based on bits of an ECC device, and error
            correction based on those bits and additional bits stored on

📋 Abstract: According to one embodiment of the invention, a method is
            disclosed for selecting a first subset of a plurality of cache
            ways in a cache for storing hardware threads identified as high
            priority hardware threads for processing by a multi-threaded
            processor in communication with the cache; assigning high
            priority hardware threads to the selected first subset;
            monitoring a cache usage of a high priority hardware thread
            assigned to the selected first subset of plurality of cache
            ways; and reassigning the assigned high priority hardware
            thread to any cache way of the plurality of cache ways if the
            cache usage of the high priority hardware thread exceeds a
            predetermined inactive cache usage threshold value based on the
            monitoring.

📄 Title: Injecting a data error into a writeback path to memory
🔢 Patent Number: US8645797
👥 Inventors: Mohan J. Kumar, Yen-Cheng Liu, Jose A. Vargas, Theodros Yigzaw
🔗 URL: https://patents.google.com/patent/US8645797
📋 Abstract: In one embodiment, a processor includes error injection
            circuitry separate and independent of debug circuitry of the
            processor. This circuitry can be used by a software developer
            to seed errors into a write-back path to system memory to
            emulate errors for purposes of validation of error recovery
            code of the software. The circuitry can include a register to
            store an address within the system memory at which an error is
            to be injected, a detection logic to detect when an instruction
            associated with the address is issued, and injection logic to
            cause the error to be injected into the address within the
            system memory responsive to the detection of the instruction.
            Other embodiments are described and claimed.

📄 Title: Machine check summary register
🔢 Patent Number: US9317360
👥 Inventors: Mohan J. Kumar, James B. Crossland, Murugasamy K. Nachimuthu, Jose A. Vargas, Theodros Yigzaw
🔗 URL: https://patents.google.com/patent/US9317360
📋 Abstract: In some implementations, a processor may include a machine
            check architecture having a plurality of error reporting
            registers able to receive data for machine check errors. A
            summary register may include a plurality of settable locations
            that each represents at least one of the error reporting
            registers. One or more of the settable locations in the summary
            register may be set to indicate whether one or more of the
            error reporting registers maintain data for a machine check
            error. Accordingly, when a machine check error occurs, the
            summary register may be accessed to identify if any error
            reporting registers in a processor's view contain valid error
            data, rather than having to read each of the error reporting
            registers in the processor's view.

📄 Title: Recovery from multiple data errors
🔢 Patent Number: US9690640
👥 Inventors: Stanislav Shwartsman, Raanan Sade, Ron Gabor, Deep Buch, Theodros Yigzaw
🔗 URL: https://patents.google.com/patent/US9690640
📋 Abstract: Mechanisms for handling multiple data errors that occur
            simultaneously are provided. A processing device may determine
            whether multiple data errors occur in memory locations that are
            within a range of memory locations. If the multiple memory
            locations are within the range of memory locations, the
            processing device may continue with a recovery process. If one
            of the multiple memory locations is outside of the range of
            memory locations, the processing device may halt the recovery
            process.

📄 Title: Method to increase cloud availability and silicon isolation using secure enclaves
🔢 Patent Number: US9798641

🔗 URL: https://patents.google.com/patent/US9798641
📋 Abstract: Methods and apparatus to increase cloud availability and
            silicon isolation using secure enclaves. A compute platform is
            configured to host a compute domain in which a plurality of
            secure enclaves are implemented. In conjunction with creating
            and deploying secure enclaves, mapping information is generated
            that maps the secure enclaves to platform/CPU resources, such
            as Intellectual Property blocks (IP) belong to the secure
            enclaves. In response to platform error events caused by errant
            platform/CPU resources, the secure enclave(s) belonging to the
            errant platform/CPU are identified via the mapping information,
            and an interrupt is directed to that/those secure enclave(s).
            In response to the interrupt, a secure enclave may be
            configured to one or more of handle the error, pass information
            to another secure enclave, and teardown the enclave. The secure
            enclave may execute an interrupt service routine that causes
            the errant platform/CPU resource to reset without resetting the
            entire platform or CPU, as applicable.

📄 Title: Clearing poison status on read accesses to volatile memory regions allocated in non-volatile memory
🔢 Patent Number: US9817738
👥 Inventors: Raj K. Ramanujan, Richard P. Mangold, Camille C. Raad, Theodros Yigzaw
🔗 URL: https://patents.google.com/patent/US9817738
📋 Abstract: Systems and methods may provide for detecting that a read
            operation is directed to a memory region while the memory
            region is in a poisoned state and clearing the poisoned state
            if volatile data stored in the memory region does not
            correspond to a known data pattern. Additionally, the memory
            region may be maintained in the poisoned state if the volatile
            data stored in the memory region corresponds to the known data
            pattern. In one example, an error may be detected, wherein the
            error is associated with a write operation directed to the
            memory region. In such a case, the poisoned state may be set
            for the volatile data in response to the error and the known
            data pattern may be written to the memory region.
